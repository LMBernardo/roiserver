TODO: Create readme

NOTE: This project is unfinished and is missing a significant number of features. I have not had time to work on this in quite a while and will likely not being working on it any further in the near future. Please use at your own risk.

Depends on https://github.com/LMBernardo/roi_handler and https://github.com/LMBernardo/rsocket which are also experimental, unfinished, and have not been updated in some time.
